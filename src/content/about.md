## 📰 Developer’s Log: The Story Behind e-Store

**Hey there!** 👋  
I’m **CSDullatt**, the developer behind *e-Store* — a modern, dark-themed game storefront inspired by **Epic Games**, **RAWG**, and **Steam**.  

This project started as a simple experiment in React, i just wanted to test RAWG api and create a simple/single page, but it quickly evolved into something much deeper — a way to explore **real-world UI/UX patterns**, **API integration**, and **scalable front-end design**. I wanted to capture the same *feeling* you get when you open a premium platform like Epic or Steam — that mix of polish, performance, and playfulness.

I built *e-Store* using:
- **React + Vite** for fast, modular development  
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive, clean design  
- **Supabase / Appwrite** for authentication & backend  
- **RTK Query** for efficient data fetching (especially on the profile system — upgraded recently 😉)

This project pushed me to learn **modern state management**, **API structuring**, and how to design an app that feels alive — with animations, skeletons, transitions, and all the little details that make UI satisfying.

> 💭 *e-Store isn’t just a copied idea — it’s my playground for building, breaking, and learning real front-end architecture.*

If you’re reading this section, it means you’re seeing *behind the curtain* — not a “news feed,” but the thoughts, updates, and ideas that keep this project evolving.

I’m always open to suggestions and collaborations — feel free to share your ideas, and we might work on them together.

Stay tuned. New ideas come when least expected.

### Dullat's note
This is just a `.md` file I dropped in — partly because I’m lazy, partly because I’m already thinking about my next project.
I wanted to learn something new here, and I did.
Maybe I’ll turn this into a real news section later… once I’ve got a new skill worth showing off.
